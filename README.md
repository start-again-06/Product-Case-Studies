# Product-Case-Studies
Product case studies showcase real-world examples of how a product solved specific customer challenges, highlighting the problem, solution, and measurable impact. They provide actionable insights into product performance, user experience, and business outcomes.
This repository is a collection of learnings from my NextLeap Product Management classes. It covers a wide range of topics including product thinking, user research, problem framing, and competitive analysis. I have also explored execution-focused skills such as roadmapping, prioritization, and metrics tracking, along with practical applications through case studies, onboarding flow design, referral strategies, and go-to-market planning. Each section reflects both theoretical concepts and hands-on exercises, making this a consolidated space for my product management journey.
